//* you can store a lot of stuff inside a variable

let a = 2;

let       b        =         1;
//*(1)    (2)      (3)       (4)  let-basic keyword  var-older

//* let  1- Keyword
//*  b   2- Variable name(when naming variables use what makes sencse)
//*  =   3- Assignment operator
//*  1;  4- variable value

console.log(a + b); 
when naming a varaible needs to start with a _, letter, 

let c = 3;
control ~ will toggle the bottom

let c = 3;

let hello = 'greet'
let Hello = 'greet again' 
//*(can't have spaces in variable names)

let hiThere = 'hey'; (Camel casing)

// * VAR LET CONST
var x = 1;
let y = 2;
const z = 3; 
//*(const value is not changable cannot reasign value)

//* DECLARATION vs INITIALIZATION
let n;
console.log(n);

n = 10;
console.log(n);

n=10;
console.log(n);
//* if a variable doesn't have a value it will default to underfined

//* LET vs CONST
let today = 'Great!';

console.log(today, elevenFifty);

today = 'lovely!'
console.log(today, elevenFifty);

//* elevenFifty = 'Super!' can't reassign a const
console.log (today, elevenFifty);
